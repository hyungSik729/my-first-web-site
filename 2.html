        <h2>CSS이란 무엇인가?</h2>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

         CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation andcontent, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] Thisseparation can improve content accessibility; provide moreflexibility and control in the specification of presentationcharacteristics; enable multiple web pages to shareformatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .cssfile, which reduces complexity and repetition in thestructural content; and enable the .css file to be cached toimprove the page load speed between the pages that share thefile and its formatting.</p>
